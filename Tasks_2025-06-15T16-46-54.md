-[x] NAME:Refactor Babylon Renderer to Feature-Based Architecture DESCRIPTION:Restructure src/components/babylon-renderer to follow bulletproof-react feature-based architecture with improved reusability, testability, and maintainability. Extract functions from hooks, create separate service files, and implement TDD approach.
--[x] NAME:Phase 1: Analysis and Planning DESCRIPTION:âœ… COMPLETED: Analyzed current babylon-renderer structure, identified functions to extract, planned feature directory structure following bulletproof-react principles. Created comprehensive types and started with engine service.
--[x] NAME:Phase 2: Create Feature Directory Structure DESCRIPTION:âœ… COMPLETED: Created src/features/babylon-renderer directory with bulletproof-react structure: components/, hooks/, services/, types/, utils/ directories.
--[x] NAME:Phase 3: Extract Services from Hooks DESCRIPTION:ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Extract pure functions from hooks into separate service files following SRP principles. âœ… Engine service completed with comprehensive tests. Next: scene-service, mesh-service, material-service.
--[x] NAME:Phase 4: Refactor Hooks to Use Services DESCRIPTION:Refactor existing hooks to become thin wrappers around services, maintaining React state management while delegating business logic to pure functions. Follow TDD approach with tests first.
--[/] NAME:Phase 5: Create Reusable Components DESCRIPTION:Break down babylon-renderer into smaller, reusable components following SRP. Create BabylonCanvas, SceneControls, MeshDisplay, and DebugPanel components with individual responsibilities.
--[/] NAME:Phase 6: Implement Types and Utils DESCRIPTION:Create comprehensive TypeScript types and utility functions for the babylon-renderer feature. Implement proper error handling, validation, and helper functions following functional programming principles.
--[ ] NAME:Phase 7: Testing and Integration DESCRIPTION:Create comprehensive test suite for all components, hooks, services, and utils. Implement Playwright component tests and ensure all functionality works correctly after refactoring.
-[/] NAME:Task 6.2: Playwright Component Integration Tests DESCRIPTION:Create comprehensive Playwright component tests for the complete BabylonRenderer architecture with visual regression testing, component interactions, and performance validation
