# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Active ADRs are maintained under the legacy folder during migration:
- docs/adr/

How to work with ADRs
- New decisions: create a new ADR under docs-new/decisions using ADR-0000-template.md, then link it here.
- Existing decisions: keep referencing docs/adr/*.md until migrated or confirmed stable.

Notes
- Do not duplicate ADRs; link to the source of truth. Only migrate when content is stable and non-deprecated.
