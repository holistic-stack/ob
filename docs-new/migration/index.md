# Migration Guides

During the transition, use the legacy migration guides as the source of truth:
- docs/migration/README.md
- docs/migration/api-migration.md
- docs/migration/from-openscad-desktop.md

We will bring non-deprecated sections into docs-new incrementally, with concise, task-focused guides.
