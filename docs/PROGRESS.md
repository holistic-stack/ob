Update PROGRESS.md to document recent TypeScript and linting improvements

## Session: 2024-07-26

### Objective
Finalize the core implementation of the `OpenScadAstVisitor`, including support for primitive shapes, CSG operations, and the `translate` transformation.

### Work Completed
1.  **Corrected Visitor Implementation:**
    - Replaced the entire content of `openscad-ast-visitor.ts` with a complete and correct implementation.
    - Fixed bugs in CSG operations (`union`, `difference`, `intersection`) to ensure proper mesh conversion and disposal of intermediate meshes, preventing memory leaks.

2.  **Implemented `translate` Transformation:**
    - Added the `visitTranslate` method to the visitor.
    - Implemented additive translation logic, which correctly modifies a mesh's existing position.
    - Ensured that `translate` nodes with multiple children perform an implicit union before applying the translation.

3.  **Comprehensive Test Suite:**
    - Replaced the content of `openscad-ast-visitor.test.ts` with a full test suite.
    - Added tests covering all primitives, CSG operations, and the `translate` method.
    - Included tests for edge cases, such as empty CSG nodes and nested transformations.

4.  **Validation:**
    - Executed the `vitest` test suite and confirmed that all tests pass, ensuring the correctness and stability of the current implementation.

### Outcome
The `OpenScadAstVisitor` is now feature-complete for core 3D operations and is ready for extension with more transformations and features. The codebase is stable, tested, and well-documented.

## Session: 2025-06-11 - TypeScript and Linting Improvements 

### Objective
Enhance code quality and maintainability through systematic TypeScript and linting improvements.

### Work Completed

#### 1. **TypeScript Enhancements** 
- **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` types with proper type definitions throughout the codebase
- **Null Safety**: Added proper null checks and removed non-null assertions where possible
- **Type Guards**: Enhanced type guards for AST node type checking
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with proper TypeScript types

#### 2. **Linting Improvements** 
- **Unused Imports**: Removed all unused imports across the codebase
- **Code Organization**: Consolidated duplicate imports and organized imports logically
- **Optional Chaining**: Added optional chaining where appropriate to improve code safety
- **Resource Management**: Ensured proper resource cleanup in tests and implementation

#### 3. **Documentation** 
- **JSDoc**: Added and updated JSDoc comments for better code documentation
- **Type Annotations**: Improved type annotations for better IDE support
- **Code Comments**: Added explanatory comments for complex logic

### Outcome
The codebase now has improved type safety, better maintainability, and follows consistent coding standards. All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved, and the code is now more robust and easier to maintain.

## Session: 2025-06-11 - TypeScript and Linting Fixes

### Objective
Resolved TypeScript import errors and investigated linting output.

### Work Completed
1.  **Resolved TypeScript Import Error:**
    - Identified incorrect import path for `BabylonRendererV2` in `src/App.tsx`.
    - Corrected the import path from `./components/babylon-renderer/babylon-renderer-v2` to `./components/babylon-renderer/babylon-renderer`.
    - Corrected the imported component name from `BabylonRendererV2` to `BabylonRenderer`.
    - Verified that `pnpm run typecheck` now runs without errors.

2.  **Investigated Linting Output:**
    - Ran `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run lint:fix` multiple times, both directly and with `--format stylish`.
    - Intentionally introduced an unused variable in `src/App.tsx` to provoke a linting error.
    - Observed no output from ESLint commands, suggesting either a very permissive configuration or suppressed output.
    - Removed the temporary unused variable.

### Outcome
Successfully resolved the primary TypeScript import error. While linting output remains elusive, the immediate and visible errors have been addressed. The project is now free of reported TypeScript compilation issues.

## Session: 2025-06-XX - Complete Pipeline Implementation

- **Error Handling**: Added graceful fallbacks when CSG2 is unavailable

#### 2. **Parser Resource Management** âœ…
- **Functional Resource Management**: Implemented Resource pattern with automatic cleanup

### Outcome
The OpenSCAD to Babylon.js pipeline now supports basic module functionality, allowing for more complex OpenSCAD designs to be converted. The implementation provides a robust, type-safe, and performant solution for converting OpenSCAD code to Babylon.js 3D scenes with comprehensive error handling and testing coverage.
