# Project Progress: OpenSCAD AST Visitor

This document tracks the major milestones and completed work on the OpenSCAD Babylon project.

## Session: 2024-07-26

### Objective
Finalize the core implementation of the `OpenScadAstVisitor`, including support for primitive shapes, CSG operations, and the `translate` transformation.

### Work Completed
1.  **Corrected Visitor Implementation:**
    - Replaced the entire content of `openscad-ast-visitor.ts` with a complete and correct implementation.
    - Fixed bugs in CSG operations (`union`, `difference`, `intersection`) to ensure proper mesh conversion and disposal of intermediate meshes, preventing memory leaks.

2.  **Implemented `translate` Transformation:**
    - Added the `visitTranslate` method to the visitor.
    - Implemented additive translation logic, which correctly modifies a mesh's existing position.
    - Ensured that `translate` nodes with multiple children perform an implicit union before applying the translation.

3.  **Comprehensive Test Suite:**
    - Replaced the content of `openscad-ast-visitor.test.ts` with a full test suite.
    - Added tests covering all primitives, CSG operations, and the `translate` method.
    - Included tests for edge cases, such as empty CSG nodes and nested transformations.

4.  **Validation:**
    - Executed the `vitest` test suite and confirmed that all tests pass, ensuring the correctness and stability of the current implementation.

### Outcome
The `OpenScadAstVisitor` is now feature-complete for core 3D operations and is ready for extension with more transformations and features. The codebase is stable, tested, and well-documented.
