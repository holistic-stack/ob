## Latest Achievement: OpenSCAD Syntax Highlighting Fix COMPLETED ✅ (2025-06-09)

**Successfully fixed OpenSCAD syntax highlighting issue - editor now properly displays colored syntax highlighting**

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: OpenSCAD editor was not showing syntax highlighting - all code appeared in plain text without colors
- **Root Cause**: Editor model was using `plaintext` language instead of `openscad`
- **Impact**: Poor developer experience with no visual distinction between keywords, functions, comments, etc.

### Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Language Registration Fix**: Added explicit language setting in editor props (`language: 'openscad'`)
- ✅ **Model Language Correction**: Force set model language to `openscad` after editor mount
- ✅ **Theme Application**: Ensured `openscad-dark` theme is properly applied at multiple points
- ✅ **Timing Fix**: Wait for editor models to be available before setting content
- ✅ **E2E Verification**: Created comprehensive tests to verify proper tokenization and highlighting

### Technical Results
- **Before**: All tokens had class `mtk1` (plaintext highlighting)
- **After**: Multiple token classes (`mtk9 mtkb` for keywords, `mtk26 mtkb` for built-ins, etc.)
- **Language**: Now correctly shows `languageId: 'openscad'` in editor model
- **Theme**: `openscad-dark` theme properly applied with color differentiation
- **Tokenization**: Monarch tokenizer working correctly with 7+ unique CSS classes

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: Created `syntax-highlighting-debug.e2e.ts` with comprehensive verification
- ✅ **Build Success**: All packages build successfully
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Syntax highlighting functionality fully tested
- ✅ **Documentation**: Updated lesson-learned.md with troubleshooting guide
