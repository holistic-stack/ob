  - Added performance validation tests

### ✅ 7. Performance Validation
- **Results**: All performance targets maintained or improved
  - ✅ 300ms debouncing (improved from 500ms)
  - ✅ <300ms AST parsing target (monitored and validated)
  - ✅ Renderer only executes on actual AST changes
  - ✅ Selective re-rendering prevents unnecessary updates
  - ✅ Memory management with automatic cleanup

### ✅ 8. Documentation and Migration Guide
- **Created**:
  - `docs/zustand-migration-guide.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
  - `docs/openscad-editor-architecture.md` - Updated architecture documentation
  - `docs/zustand-refactor-summary.md` - This summary document

## Technical Achievements

### 1. State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Centralized store with selective subscriptions
export const useOpenSCADStore = create<OpenSCADState>()(
  subscribeWithSelector((set, get) => ({
    // State
    code: '' as OpenSCADCode,
    ast: [] as ASTData,
    parseErrors: [] as readonly ParseError[],
    isParsing: false,
    
    // Actions with performance optimization
    updateCode: (code: string) => void, // 300ms debounced
    parseAST: (code: string) => Promise<Result<ASTData, ParseError[]>>,
  }))
);
```

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: Reduced from 500ms to 300ms (40% improvement)
- **Selective Rendering**: Components only re-render on relevant state changes
- **Change Detection**: AST parsing only triggered on actual code changes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 3. Developer Experience Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with branded types
- **Error Handling**: Consistent Result<T,E> patterns
- **Testing**: Improved testability with mockable hooks
- **Debugging**: Centralized state inspection and monitoring

## Breaking Changes

### 1. VisualizationPanel Props
**Removed props** (now managed by Zustand):
- `astData?: readonly ASTNode[]`
- `parseErrors?: readonly ParseError[]`
- `isParsing?: boolean`

**Migration**:
```typescript
// Before
<VisualizationPanel astData={ast} parseErrors={errors} isParsing={parsing} />

// After
<VisualizationPanel /> // AST data automatically subscribed from store
```

### 2. Import Changes
**New imports required**:
```typescript
import {
  useOpenSCADAst,
  useOpenSCADErrors,
  useOpenSCADStatus,
  useOpenSCADActions
} from '../stores';
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Refactor
- Debouncing: 500ms
- Re-renders: On every state change
- Memory: Manual cleanup required
- State management: Distributed across components

### After Refactor
- Debouncing: 300ms (✅ 40% improvement)
- Re-renders: Only on relevant state changes (✅ Optimized)
- Memory: Automatic cleanup (✅ Improved)
- State management: Centralized with selective subscriptions (✅ Optimized)

## Test Results

### Store Tests
```
✅ OpenSCAD AST Store (16 tests)
  ✅ initial state (1)
  ✅ updateCode action (3)
  ✅ parseAST action (4)
  ✅ error management actions (2)
  ✅ store management actions (3)
  ✅ selector hooks (1)
  ✅ performance requirements (2)
```

### Performance Validation
- ✅ 300ms debouncing requirement met
- ✅ Performance tracking against targets
- ✅ AST parsing within 300ms target
- ✅ Selective rendering optimization

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Type Safety
- Branded types for domain safety (`OpenSCADCode`, `ASTData`)
- Strict TypeScript with no `any` types
- Result<T,E> for consistent error handling

### 2. Functional Programming
- Pure functions for state updates
- Immutable data structures
- Side-effect isolation in store actions

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Built-in performance metrics tracking
- Automatic target validation
- Debug utilities for state inspection

## Future Enhancements

### 1. CSG2 Integration
Ready for extension to manage CSG2 conversion pipeline:
```typescript
interface OpenSCADState {
  // ... existing state
  csg2Data: CSG2Data | null;
  convertToCSG2: (ast: ASTData) => Promise<Result<CSG2Data, CSG2Error[]>>;
}
```

### 2. State Persistence
Can be extended with persistence for user sessions:
```typescript
const persistedStore = persist(useOpenSCADStore, {
  name: 'openscad-editor-state'
});
```

### 3. Collaborative Editing
Architecture supports real-time collaborative features:
```typescript
const collaborativeStore = {
  // ... existing state
  collaborators: [],
  syncState: (remoteState) => void,
};
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **All existing functionality preserved** - No regressions
✅ **Performance targets maintained** - 300ms debouncing, <300ms AST parsing
✅ **Clean separation of concerns** - Centralized state management
✅ **Improved testability** - Mockable hooks and isolated testing
✅ **Zero TypeScript errors** - Strict typing maintained
✅ **Visual regression tests pass** - UI functionality preserved

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Zustand Benefits
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Built-in performance optimizations
