## Development Methodology (MANDATORY)

### TDD Cycle Implementation
```
1. Write failing test (Red)
2. Implement minimal code (Green)
3. Refactor with patterns (Refactor)
4. Validate quality gates (80+ score)
```

### Functional Programming Requirements
- **Pure functions** for all transformations
- **Immutable data structures** with Object.freeze()
- **Result<T,E> patterns** for error handling
- **Function composition** for complex operations

### Quality Gates (80+ Score Required)
```bash
npm run validate:all  # Must pass before merge
npm run test:coverage  # 90% coverage minimum
npm run lint  # Zero warnings/errors
npm run typecheck  # Strict TypeScript compliance
```

- [x] < 16ms render times for 3D operations
- [x] 300ms debouncing for real-time parsing
- [x] WebGL2 compatibility and optimization
- [x] Strict TypeScript with zero `any` types

### Quality Requirements ✅

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (UI integration pending)
- [x] Functional programming patterns throughout
- [x] Comprehensive error handling with Result<T,E>
- [x] Production-ready performance and memory management

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Monaco Worker Configuration**: Use vite-plugin-monaco-editor
- **CSG Performance**: Implement geometry optimization and caching
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper parser disposal and mesh cleanup
- **WebGL Compatibility**: Fallback to WebGL1 if needed

### Development Risks
- **Complexity Management**: Strict feature-based organization
- **Integration Issues**: Incremental integration with testing
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Early performance monitoring
- **Quality Drift**: Automated quality gates and CI/CD

## Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 1** with Zustand store implementation
2. **Follow TDD methodology** for all development
3. **Validate quality gates** after each feature
4. **Maintain documentation** throughout development
5. **Test incrementally** to catch issues early

This plan provides a systematic approach to building a production-ready OpenSCAD 3D visualization application with modern React patterns, functional programming principles, and comprehensive quality validation.
