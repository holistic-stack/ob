# Baseline Artifacts - Clean State Analysis

**Generated:** 2025-01-04  
**Task:** Step 1 - Establish clean baseline & reproduce issues

## Environment Setup
- ‚úÖ `pnpm install` completed successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning about ignored build scripts for @tailwindcss/oxide and esbuild
- üîß Suggestion to run `pnpm approve-builds` for build script dependencies

## Baseline Results

### 1. Tests (`pnpm test`)
- **Status:** Running with extensive logging output (truncated)
- **Key Observations:**
  - AST generation processes are active and functional
  - OpenSCAD parser processing cube, sphere, scale, rotate operations
  - Some conversion warnings noted (e.g., "Scale node must have children")
  - Tests appear to be executing successfully with detailed debug output

### 2. Type Checking (`pnpm type-check`)
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILED with 636 errors across 77 files
- **Exit Code:** 1
- **Major Issues:**
  - Property initialization problems
  - Type assignment issues with exactOptionalPropertyTypes
  - Private constructor access violations
  - Missing properties and type incompatibilities
  - Implicit any types and namespace resolution issues

### 3. Code Quality (`pnpm biome:check`)
- **Status:** ‚ùå FAILED with 441 errors and 132 warnings
- **Exit Code:** 1  
- **Fixes Applied:** 28 files automatically fixed
- **Major Issues:**
  - Node.js import protocol violations (missing `node:` prefix)
  - Non-null assertions requiring safer alternatives
  - Unused imports and variables
  - Static-only classes and explicit any types

## Summary
The project baseline shows a **partially functional state** with:
- ‚úÖ Working test infrastructure and OpenSCAD parsing
- ‚ùå Significant TypeScript type issues (636 errors)
- ‚ùå Code quality issues (441 linting errors)

These baseline artifacts will be used for diff-verification after implementing fixes.
